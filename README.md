# Coconut Club Website

This project serves as an example of my work as a freelance developer. The website is a multipage static site built for Coconut Club Beach Cafe. I have obtained permission from the restaurant to share this website as part of my portfolio, showcasing my skills in front-end web development.

## ðŸª´ About Me
I'm a freelance full stack developer with a passion for crafting innovative web solutions. With expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies, I have successfully delivered a wide range of projects, including web applications, RESTful APIs, and database management. I continually strive to solve complex problems and provide efficient, user-friendly solutions.

## Background

The Coconut Club website was developed using React and Bootstrap. By creating this website, I aimed to showcase my skills in front-end development, including React components, state management, and responsive design. The website features a visually appealing layout and provides relevant information about the business.

## Features

- Built with React to create modular and reusable components
- Utilized Bootstrap for responsive design and pre-built UI components
- Responsive design for seamless viewing on various devices

## Future Plans

- Update the website with more high-quality images directly from the Coconut Club Beach Cafe.
- Add a PDF version of the menu for easy download and printing.
- Integrate a third-party booking site to facilitate surf lessons and photography bookings.
- Continuously improve the website's performance, design, and user experience.
