      <h2 className="title">WELCOME</h2>
        <p>At Coconut Club Beach Cafe, we are more than just a cafe. We are a labor of love and a culmination of passion for the ocean, surf, and vibrant culinary experiences. Let us introduce ourselves and share our story. </p>
        <p>Founded by Sumith, a seasoned surf instructor and hospitality professional, Coconut Club is the realization of a lifelong dream. With years of experience working as a surf instructor and just down the beach at Salty Swami's, Sumith's love for the beach and his expertise in hospitality converged to create this beachside haven.</p>
        <p>Our journey began in early 2020 when Sumith opened his first restaurant, a vegan cafe, in Hikkaduwa. Unfortunately, challenges posed by the global pandemic altered plans. Undeterred, we adapted and transformed our vision to create Coconut Club Beach Cafe, a place where locals and travelers alike can immerse themselves in the beauty of our backyard beach.
        </p>
        <h2 className="title">VALUES & VISION</h2>
        <p>We believe in the profound fortune of being able to embrace the beauty of the Indian Ocean. We understand the significance of slowing down, appreciating life's simple pleasures, and finding joy in the present moment. These values are at the core of everything we do at Coconut Club. Our vision is to create a welcoming space where everyone can experience our beloved beach just as we do. We aim to foster a sense of belonging and connection, where you can find solace, rejuvenation, and pure enjoyment by the ocean's edge.</p>
        <h2 className="title">MISSION</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to serve delicious food crafted from fresh, colorful ingredients. Our menu reflects our commitment to providing vibrant and nourishing culinary creations. But it's not just about the food - it's about the experience. We invite you to immerse yourself in our laid-back environment, where the focus is on being, rather than doing. Relax, savor the flavors, and create cherished memories as you bask in the tranquility of our beachside paradise.</p>
